# patience-sort-lis
An `O(n lg n)` algorithm for the longest increasing subsequence problem. This algorithm is based on patience sorting. The algorithm reads `n`, the length of the sequence, then it reads `n` space separated values. The output is then written on the screen. The programs then prompts the user for another value of `n` and so on.
